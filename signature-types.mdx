## Manual Upload

Upload an image of your signature for quick integration. Resize and crop as needed. This method saves time if you have a pre-made signature.

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,Python">
  ```javascript
  // Load uploaded image
  const fileInput = document.getElementById('upload');
  fileInput.addEventListener('change', (e) => {
    const file = e.target.files[0];
    const reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onload = (event) => {
      img.src = event.target.result;
    };
    reader.readAsDataURL(file);
  });
  ```
  ```python
  # Process uploaded file
  from PIL import Image
  img = Image.open('uploaded_signature.png')
  img = img.resize((200, 80))
  img.save('resized_signature.png')
  ```
